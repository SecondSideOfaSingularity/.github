# SecondSideOfaSingularity's Mod Repository
Welcome to the development repository for tracking the Game Mods that I am either planning or currently working on. The list of games that I can currently mod for is as follows (but this is subject to change):
 - [Dragon Age: Origins](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Origins)
 - [Hogwarts Legacy](https://hogwarts-legacy.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Legacy_Wiki)

## Description
To keep things simple, completed mods are not made available here but can be found on the [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/), or via the direct URLs provided in the [Nexus URLs](#nexus-urls) section. If you have been granted access to a project for testing purposes, you should see that Mod listed after heading to the [Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/SecondSideOfaSingularity/repositories) tab.

If you need to report a bug you've found or wish to give feedback on one of my Mods, click the related Mod's name in the [Provide Feedback](#provide-feedback) section.
